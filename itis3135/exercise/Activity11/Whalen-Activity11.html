						<h3>Rachel Clancy</h3><br>
						<p>I’m Rachel Clancy, but most everyone knows me as Rae. I’m 20 years old and was born in Warren, Ohio. When I was about five, my family moved to Concord, North Carolina and I’ve been in the area ever since. In early 2021 I moved into an apartment in the University City area and started attending UNCC. I started to really get into art when I was ten or eleven. I was really inspired by online artists and old 2D animated movies such as “The Lion King,” “Spirit: Stallion of the Cimarron,” and “The Road to El Dorado.” Because of these movies, I really wanted to work as an animator for Disney or Pixar, so I started practicing cartoons. I was especially intrigued by the personification of animals in the first two films, and found creating expressions and personalities for animals a lot more fun and fluid. I practiced this style almost exclusively for a while, only branching out into painting and realism a few years ago. In high school, I did a lot of painting and realism for my art courses. I actually really liked creating in those styles, and do so regularly as well. Through the years I’ve found creating art to be very therapeutic, using it as a creative outlet for emotions. Who needs therapy when you can draw cartoon cats, right?</p>
